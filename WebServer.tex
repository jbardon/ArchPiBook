\chapter{Web server}
\section{Nginx versus Apache}
In web servers world there are three major actors: Apache, nginx and 
IIS (by Microsoft). If you look at the number of production uses\footnote{Netcraft 
survey available on \href{http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/02/03/february-
2014-web-server-survey.html}{news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/02/03/february-2014-
web-server-survey.html}} you will see that I followed the distribution from above 
it means \textasciitilde{}55\% for our old Apache and \textasciitilde{}15\% for 
the two others.
\\\\
However, it appears like Apache decreases by 5\% and nginx get these same 5\% all 
that between January 2014 and February 2014. Now, I can tell you I choosed to use 
nginx instead of Apache for some reasons and the nginx rise is one of them.
\\\\
Let's sum up some advantages and drawbacks of using nginx instead of apache. Few 
of them are extracted from raspbian-france.fr\footnote{Article on the same topic 
(in french), see \href{http://raspbian-france.fr/installer-nginx-raspbian-
accelerez-serveur-web-raspberry}{raspbian-france.fr/installer-nginx-raspbian-
accelerez-serveur-web-raspberry}} but others are personnal.

\section{Installation}
To run a non-static website, nginx is not sufficient we also need to install PHP 
-- for dynamic pages -- and a mySQL database to save our precious data. In 
addition, we will install phpMyAdmin which a tool -- written in PHP -- to manage 
a mySQL database through a web interface. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Install a full web server]
# php-fpm is the nginx module for PHP
# mariadb is a mySQL database
$ pacman -S nginx php-fpm mariadb phpmyadmin

# Enable and run services
$ systemctl enable nginx php-fpm mysqld
$ systemctl start nginx php-fpm mysqld
\end{lstlisting} 

Nginx server works well but php is not enabled in configuration files. Moreover, 
there are some incompatibilties troubles in initial setup.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Enable php in nginx]
# First problem: welcome file directory is not set in
# availables directories for php
#
# Update php config file
# Search open_basedir, add ":/usr/share/nginx/html/" at the end
#
$ nano /etc/php/php.ini

# Second problem: php not enabled and contains bad setup
# in nginx configuration file
#
# Uncomment (remove #) on the following block and change it 
# to fit the example
#
$ nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
#
location ~ \.php$ {
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html; # Fix path to php files

# Use sockets   
#   fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000; 
    fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
            
    fastcgi_index  index.php;

# Use fastcgi.conf file
#   fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /scripts$fastcgi_script_name;
#   include        fastcgi_params;
    include        fastcgi.conf;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The last thing to do is enabling mysql extensions in php configuration files to 
be able to perform SQL queries on local database through php scripts.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Enable php in nginx]
$ nano /etc/php/php.ini

# Remove ";" before mysql and mysqli extensions
;extension=mysql.so
;extension=mysqli.so
\end{lstlisting}

Each time you change nginx or php configuration files you have to reload and 
restart the corresponding service for it to take into account your changes.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Reload and restart a service]
# Restart only considered service
$ systemctl reload nginx php-fpm 
$ systemctl restart nginx php-fpm
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Basic verifications}
The next step is to check our web server with basic verifications to test whether
the installation worked well. We will simply try to access to the default nginx 
page remotely, create a php page and display it and finally access to local 
database. 

\subsection{Nginx and php}
During installation process, nginx places a welcome page called \emph{index.html} 
in \texttt{/usr/share/nginx/html} directory. However Php gives no sample to test 
with nginx therefore we will create a new php script in welcome page directory.
\\\\
The content of this new script will simply display php configuration on 
your server.
\lstset{language=php,caption=Php simple script}
\lstinputlisting{code/index.php}

The goal of these test is to access to \emph{index.html} and \emph{index.php} 
from a remote web browser to check if nginx and php work well on your server. 
\\\\
To perform that, type the IP address of your RPi on your PC web browser -- 
followed by /index.html and then /index.php -- and you will see nginx welcome page 
and php config respectively.

\subsection{MySQL}
% 2 things : mysql and mysql + php
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Test mySQL installation]
$ mysql -uroot    # Connect to local database with root user
> show databases; # List of databases
> use mysql;      # Go into mysql database
> show tables;    # List of tables in current database

# Perform SQL query to list users
> select host, user, pasword from user;
> exit; # Logout from local database

# If nothing works try to launch mysql install script
# user: user account used by mysql service
# ldata: path to MariaDB data directory
# basedir: path to MariaDB installation directory
$ mysql_install_db --user=mysql --ldata=/var/lib/mysql 
    --basedir=/usr
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Set custom directory}
Nginx default setup set this directory as the root of 
your server but websites are usually hosted in \texttt{/var/www} so I will explain 
you how to move the welcome page into that new file.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Move nginx welcome page]
# Create /var/www directory and move into it
$ cd /var
$ mkdir www # Create a folder named "www"
$ cd mkdir

# Copy directory (with -r) source destination
$ cp -r /usr/share/nginx/html/ /var/www/

# Move a directory but if source and destination
# are in same directory rename source
$ mv /var/www/html /var/www/home
\end{lstlisting} 

Before trying to access to your website it will be necessary to configure nginx 
and php for the new path. The sample nginx configuration file contains some 
help to do specific things so we will save it and create a new one with the 
following example.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption=Configure nginx and php]
# Save and change nginx file
$ mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.old
$ nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # See following example

# Update php config file
# Search open_basedir and add ":/var/www/" at the end
$ nano /etc/php/php.ini

# Do not forget to reload and restart services
\end{lstlisting} 
\lstset{language=bash,caption=nginx configuration}
\lstinputlisting{code/nginx.conf}

% /usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin
% link + enable + nginx config
% domain
\end{document}
