\section*{Author words}
I am not an expert in linux system as ArchLinux and even less in electronic 
stuff. However, as a developer I like to tinker with my toy which is 
a Raspberry Pi. I had a lot of troubles when I decided to find uses for it 
and tried to install some third party software. As a result, I am glad to 
write this "book" to help you to install things on your RPi with ArchLinux.
