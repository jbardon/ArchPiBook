About author
------------
I am not an expert in linux system as ArchLinux and even less in electronic stuff. However, as a developer I like to tinker with my toy which is a Raspberry Pi. I had a lot of troubles when I decided to find uses for it and tried to install some third party software. As a result, I am glad to write this "book" to help you to install things on RPi with ArchLinux.
